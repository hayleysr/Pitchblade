//This visualizer class is a generic visualizer for any data stream. Its primary functionality is as a first-in, first-out queue, displaying a fixed number of recent data points
//It uses a timer to gather new data and repaint itself on a regular interval
//Its y-axis is customizable, and it has an optional horizontal dotted line, which can be used to display user-defined thresholds.

    //and a message thread, which handles everything else. The audio thread is initialized by the DAW
